- Within every iteration try to add what you liked & did not like about the answer you were just given

- Exploit the generative nature of LLM s by trying to get multiple answers for the same problem and collect good parts from all 

- Informed Decision Making: support your decision-making process through viewing different perspectvies & approaches, ask the LLM to give you different scenarios and possibilities, clarify what is the cause/root of your projected variation?
  - "Give me three possible emails which totally different tones, and compare and contrast them" 

- For software related solutions, we can ask it to give us multiple solutions and then we can test them and choose the most performant one. Writing effective tests could be leveraged in this scenario. Recognize the objective criteria first!

- You can ask GPT to provide you different analyses on your matter:
  - SWOT: Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
  - PESTLE: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental
  - SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
 
- Breakdown of a great prompt:
  - Intruction: the actual request well explained and clarified
  - Information: providing detailed context and explainig unclear or new parts
  - Patterns/Examples: provide something the bot can learn from ( could come from our preferences )
  - Output/Format: providing the wanted structure, it helps guide the thinking of the bot, you can take control of the output format
  - Trigger: You can provide the starting point for the bot, giving some ideas how to start 

- Machine Learning analysis techniques:
  - Classification: labeling, putting things into categories.
      - example: you can copy paste comments of your Linkedinpost and have GPT process and classify them in a table based on their sentiment, summary of comment, and other crucial information which can be tapped into. No need to data cleansing and training model. 
  - Clustering: take our data and try to group it together where common properties can be found, segmenting our market aor customers, trying to group them based on attributes, we can identify commonalities 
  - Prediction: Asking the bot predict, here is what you see, based on that, what else can be seen?
